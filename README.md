# W_CS_CreateClass

Using Visual Studio, create a new console application project. Name the project CreateClass. 
Let this class have the following properties: name, birth date (choose the data type you might think suitable). 
Also add an enumeration to your class, called Genders. The person can be Male or Female! 
Override the ToString() method of the Person, and return some information about the class in it.

Add a new class to your project called Employee. Derive this class from Person, since an 
Employee is a person. Let the employee have new properties like salary and profession. 
Override the ToString() method of the Person in order to return these new pieces of information as well. 
Extend the Employee class to have a reference to a Room class. Let the Room class be a simple class with a single integer, the room number.

Modify the Employee class to implement the ICloneable interface.
